# Junho Park's Worship Set List
This is a list of my own worship sets that I've been keeping track of over the years. I hope this will serve as a helpful resource for folks looking for ideas around building worship sets. Please feel free to get in touch with me if you'd like to chat about what you see here.

John 4 - the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well, talking about spiritual thirst.

## 2019-04-14 (ICC - Dr. Steve - Acoustic worship w/o drums & bass)
Theology of work related sermon. Look at the way that we will continue to work for God's glory in heaven and how that ought to motivate our service for God in the present.

* "Good morning everyone - We are glad to have you join us for worship this morning. At this time why don’t we all stand and spend some time blessing the Lord our God by singing Him songs of praise? In Psalm 103:1-5 it says // "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name! Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's." // And btw our band this morning is without drums and bass which IMO is ripe for playing older worship songs - so most of the songs we’ll be singing will be roughly 20 or so years old. Hope you’re okay with that :smile:"

## 2019-04-07 (ICC - Dr. Steve)
"The Intermediate State" between our death and the final state of eternity when the New Heaven and New Earth will appear. The focus will be on God perfecting us and making us to be Christlike so that we can rule with him - the work that he began in us in this life on earth continuing into the life after our death. Songs that could work: God healing us, restoring us, or simply songs of his greatest and love toward us. Hymn “Amazing Grace” would actually fit pretty well as a closing song for this message. => Message update: God's presence on earth

* Read Psalm 100:1-5
* May the Peoples Praise You (C)
* W/ Easter just a couple of weeks away I wanted to read a book in the Bible that focuses on Jesus - so I’ve been reading thru the book of Mark in recent days. And as I’ve been reading thru it I’ve been struck by how Jesus was so intimately integrated into the lives of all diff kinds of people. Like, when he chose to heal people he often touched them—and many of these were people who were outcasts who rarely got physical affection from others. He had meals with tax collectors who were seen as very corrupt, greedy, and immoral by many, he showed much grace to prostitutes and I could go on and on. // As we sing this next song that focuses in Jesus may there be facets of Jesus that speak to your hearts and remind you of just how worthy of our praise is Jesus is.
* Jesus (G)
* Build My Life (G)
* Sermon
* I Stand Amazed (E)
* Worthy, Worthy (G)
* Prayer song: Soon (D)

## 2019-02-24 (ICC - Dr. Steve - Communion Sunday - No electric guitar)
Part 2 message on 2 Samuel 11-12. Focus on God not necessarily focused on us living a moral life but more about our relationship w/ God. Our repentance reflects we are under God's leadership & what we desire more than anything is intimacy w/ Him. Songs that focus on intimacy with God, relationship with him, etc. will work well.

* Note: DADGAD tuning
* Man of Sorrows (D) => Acoustic guitar start
* As we sing this next song and continue in our worship to God, may we remember that being a Christian is SO much more than living a moral life, going to church, reading the Bible, etc. While these things I’ve just mentioned are all good things, what God has made clear in the Bible is that He wants to be in a relationship with us. May we be a church that consistently longs for more of God’s presence in our lives and hungers for closeness with God.
* Holy Spirit (D) => Acoustic guitar start
* Praise the Father Praise the Son (D) => Acoustic guitar start
* Sermon
* Come Thou Fount (E)
* Communion song: Mighty is the Power of the Cross (F) => Acoustic guitar-driven
* Psalm 23 (Surely Goodness, Surely Mercy) (A)
* Prayer time: Everlasting God (New Life) (G) => Did not sing due to lack of time

## 2019-02-14 (ICC - Small group)

* Refiner’s Fire (E)

## 2019-02-10 (ICC - Dr. Steve)

Our repentance reflects we are under God's leadership & what we desire more than anything is intimacy w/ Him. Songs that focus on intimacy with God, relationship with him, etc. will work well.

* Good morning, everyone. Before we enter into a time of singing together, I wanted to share one thing - which is that some of you in this room might not particularly enjoy singing and may not feel comfortable singing in a more public setting like this. But I wanted to remind you all that this corporate singing that we do on Sunday mornings is not at all about how well we sing from a musical standpoint but rather, it’s all about declaring truths about who God is, what He has done in our lives, and who we are in God’s eyes and declaring these truths to God, to each other—which is often really powerful and encouraging, and declaring them to ourselves because all of us are forgetful people and we are prone to wandering away from God. // And now that I’ve shared all of that, I want to invite you to stand with us as long as you are comfortable with standing up and sing with us as we sing about Jesus our Savior - the name above all names, blessed redeemer.
* Jesus Messiah (G)
* May the Peoples Praise You (C)
* Share following while keyboard playing intro of next song:  In the book of John chapter 3, verses 16 & 17 it says that "God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son [Jesus], that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him."
As we sing the next song, may we be moved by God's kindness & goodness in giving us Jesus, and being put to death on the cross for our sins, so that we could be in a loving relationship with Him.
* Living Hope (C)
* Sermon
* Build My Life (G)
* Who You Are (G) => Skipped due to lack of time
* Prayer song: Soon (D) => Skipped due to lack of time


## 2019-02-03 (ICC - Dr. Steve - Communion Sunday)
2 Samuel 11-12 - David’s sin with Bathsheba. Focused on the struggle for us to own up to our own sin, and yet how God’s spirit brings us to that place of confession and the forgiveness we find from God when we repent of our sins

* Good morning, everyone! We’re glad that you’re able to join us for worship this morning & I’m thankful that the weather has really warmed up in the last day. // Why don’t we start our service this morning by singing the following song that speaks to God’s goodness and his faithful love for us. If you’re comfortable with standing up, we want to invite you to stand with us and sing the following songs of worship with us
* Good Good Father (G)
* Next song we’re going to sing is an upbeat worship song that I wanted to introduce to all of you. And being that it’s a song that comes from Psalm 67, I thought it’d be appropriate for us to do a congregational reading of Psalm 67. So, as I read this passage I’m gonna ask that you read it out loud with me // May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine on us so that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations. // May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you. // May the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you rule the peoples with equity, and guide the nations of the earth. // May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you. // The land yields its harvest; God, our God, blesses us. // May God bless us still, so that all the ends of the earth will fear him.
* May the Peoples Praise You (C)
* Great Are You Lord (G)

* Share - so easy for us to place our worth in very fleeting things like our wealth, the kind of jobs we have, the kind of house we live in… and the following song reminds us to place our worth in Jesus’s love for us.

## 2018-12-30 (ICC - Dr. Steve - Communion Sunday)
Charge for the new year. Challenge the church to grow in love. Because God loves us, we are to love one another. Invite the church to reflect on how we are loving in our lives, and the nature of Christian love--looking after the interest of others over our own, etc.
